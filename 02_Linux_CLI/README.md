Hello Kottans, this is the second task in this course and here is what I got when I studied it.

The first module was elementary for me.

I am already familiar with Linux and am a fan of it, because I like to tell the machine directly what it needs to do. However, it is never too late to repeat what has been learned, so I enthusiastically set to work. In the first task, I appreciated the approach suitable for beginners. All commands are clear and easy to remember.

The second module is slightly more complicated than the previous one.

User rights and permissions are already being studied here. I see the disadvantage that the resolutions in the examples are presented only in letters, although the digital way of writing them, in my opinion, is much more convenient. Other than that, there was nothing else that made me notice. In general, I think that the first two modules give a good idea of ​​how the command line works.

All the most interesting things start from the third level.

There are already exercises for learning the relative path to files (the disadvantage is that there is no practice on the main path, but we remember that the course is for beginners? Yes, knowing the relative path notation is useful). Commands related to printing from the command line also appear. I don't think this is a necessary command these days, but what if you want to prank your friend? Also given is an excellent example of working with a command -man.

The fourth module aroused the greatest interest in me.

More serious commands have already gone here, such as -df, which allows you to find out the free disk space on your machine (by the way, we remember from the previous module that it can be used with keys), and also find out how you can find and neutralize processes that interfere with working in our system. It already looks like real system administration, and I think it's great that this part was included in the course.

All in all, this is a great course for beginners and I would recommend it for schools. More practice ladies and gentlemen Kottans!
